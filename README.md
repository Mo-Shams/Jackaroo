# JackarooFX 🎮

This is our custom version of **Jackaroo**, the classic Middle Eastern board game — rebuilt from the ground up in **JavaFX**, with new visuals, sounds, and enhanced single-player gameplay.

Play exclusively against **unique CPU characters** in a world full of animated cards, step-by-step marble movement, dynamic themes, and expressive reactions.

- **Step-by-Step Marble Movement**: Includes forward moves, backward moves, and safezone entry — all clearly visualized.
- **Highlighted Marble Paths**: Valid paths are shown based on the selected marble and card.
- **Unique CPU Characters**: Each with a name, face, themed appearance, and emotional reactions.
- **CPU Talk System**: CPUs speak occasionally via a message box with a controlled probability.
- **Dynamic Themes**: Switch themes instantly (press `T`) — changes background, music, cardbacks, marbles, and CPU styles.
- **Original Music & SFX**: Each theme has its own soundtrack, with persistent sound effects for actions.
- **Interactive UI**: Hover effects, smooth highlighting, action feedback, and visual cues for turns and moves.
- **Overlay Feedback**: Descriptive overlays for invalid moves, trap cells, and 7-card splits.
